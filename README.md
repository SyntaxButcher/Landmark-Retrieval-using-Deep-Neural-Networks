# Landmark-Retrieval-using-Deep-Neural-Networks

This is our project on Landmark Retrieval using 2 different models and to show how siamese network(similarity score output) outperforms a ResNet101 classification network for Landmark Retrieval.

*We haven't uploaded the trained model weights due to github size restrictions*
